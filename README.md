# About

This is a small music visualisation experiment I put together using just vanilla Javascript and a HTML5 canvas element.

The Javascript code is dependent on access to certain features of the [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) & [Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) APIs that are common to most modern web browsers.

# Wish list
- add random seagull noises at the end?
- try adding gravity to the waves, in an attempt to get rid of the strobing
